# Oviramcs

This repo is to save my Emacs configurations. I use [Chemacs2](https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2), to be able to play with different configurations, currently:

- Brave, originated from the [Brave Clojure Book](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/);
- Spacemacs (default).

## Dependencies

- Chemacs2 cloned in `~/.emacs.d` and Spacemacs cloned in `~/spacemacs`. Please refer to their documentation for more details;
- `rg` (or `ag` or `pt` or `ack`) search tool installed, most distros have glitches when they default to `grep`.

## Troubleshooting

- If on the splash screen the icons seem broken, a round of `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` and a restart should fix them.
- Oviramcs is my first name reversed, with a (Emacs flavoured) *cs* suffix and a *v* (for Vim) thrown in the mix.
