# Oviramcs

This repo is to save my Emacs configuration, currently a Spacemacs one. 

In the other (non default) branch there is a more basic one.

The word Oviramcs itself is my first name reversed, with a (Emacs flavoured) *cs* suffix and a *v* (for Vim) thrown in the mix.

## Assumptions

- `rg` (or another search tool) installed, the default `helm` with `grep` doesn't skip ignored files.
