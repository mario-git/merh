# Oviramcs

This repo is to save my Emacs configuration, currently a Spacemacs/hybrid one.

In the other (non default) branch there is a more basic one.

The word Oviramcs itself is my first name reversed, with a (Emacs flavoured) *cs* suffix and a *v* (for Vim) thrown in the mix.

## Dependencies

- a few custom themes, installable via `get-custom-themes` script.
- `rg` (or another search tool) installed, the default `helm` with `grep` doesn't skip ignored files.

## Troubleshooting

- If on the splash screen the icons seem broken, a round of `SPC SPC all-the-icons-install-fonts` and a restart should fix them.
