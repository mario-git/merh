# Oviramcs

This repo is to save my Emacs configurations. I use [Chemacs2](https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2), to be able to play with different configurations, currently:

- Vanilla (default), a custom one started from scratch;
- Spacemacs.

## Dependencies

- Chemacs2 cloned in `~/.emacs.d` and Spacemacs cloned in `~/spacemacs`.
- `rg` search tool installed.

## Troubleshooting

- If on the splash screen the icons seem broken, a round of `M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` and a restart should fix them.
